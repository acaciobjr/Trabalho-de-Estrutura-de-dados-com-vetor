# Trabalho-de-Estrutura-de-dados-com-vetor

This algorithm made in C Language aims to introduce the student to the study of data structure.
The program 'populates' a vector with ten integers between 0 and 100 and performs orders such as: showing the element with the highest value, counting how many elements are even, what is the value of the sum of the numbers, ordering the elements in the reverse way to the one originally drawn and sorts all elements in ascending order.
